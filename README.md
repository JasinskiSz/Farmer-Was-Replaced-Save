# The Farmer Was Replaced

I treat this file as my notes.

## My to-do list
- [ ] in the the_PUMPking script:
	- [ ] use fertilizer for pumpkins when replanting and check can_harvest() value at that point. Potential pumpkin/second increase.
	- [ ] think of a way to use drone when it waits for a pumpkin to grow. This could be flagged and it could plant/harvest/do something else at the time of waiting. To plant, it could check for nearest unused space and plant there. Obsolete if fertilizer is going to be used.
